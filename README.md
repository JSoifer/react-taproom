## React Taproom
## By Julianne Soifer

A react version of angular taproom project.

## This app will

* Display a list of Kegs currently on Tap
* Allow a user to add a keg to the list
* Allow a user to edit a keg on the list
* Track the full/empty status of each Keg on the list


## Initial Planning

* updated plan after learning more about development using react with state.

## Notes

Adapting this app to react presented some challenges.  First, the components did not translate directly and the transfer of data was different.  It took a lot of thought to coordinate the react components, and I found myself trying to make them fit into my angular composition instead of allowing them to be part of their own structure.  I also have not been able to take the svg graphic from the angular app - I will have to do some more research and experimenting.
